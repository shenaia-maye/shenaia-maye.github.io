                <h2>The Heroism of Dalisay</h2>
                <p>Hero. What do you think of when someone says the word heroism? A hero is someone that has immense
                    amounts of courage, intelligence, and strong will power. There are many more characteristics of a
                    hero such as, being a respected and good leader. Also, they have to be able to think of other people
                    over themselves. Cardo is a well-spirited individual who attempts to protect the society from law
                    breaking corruptions from various types of criminals, such as drug addicts, human-trafficking
                    syndicates, gamblers, dog butchers, and more. He tends to punish villainous criminals by brute force
                    but usually refuses to kill them, only if the rule-breakers stop fighting and surrender.</p>
                <p>Just like Cardo, a hero is not someone that can fly, see through walls or has some incredible super
                    power. A hero is someone that stands up for something they believe in and fights for it to better
                    someone else’s life, often times putting their own life at risk. Heroes are not people that have the
                    ability to fly, turn invisible, read someone’s mind or has super strength. A hero doesn’t go around
                    the world fighting evil monsters and super villains. They don’t have immense amounts of wealth or
                    power.
                </p>
                <p>Cardo saves hundreds of lives. He take the risk of death and losing of someone he dearly love. Just
                    like him, a total hero is someone who sacrifices and never hesistates to throw bullets to the mouths
                    of his enemies. He may be imperfect, but he is someone that can save you. The heroism of dalisay
                    reminds us that every soldier is a hero, they may not wear capes but they have dignity to save and
                    seek the security of their fellow countrymen.</p>
